# Tensorflow-NN-To-Categorize-MNIST-Dataset
Two layer convolutional neural network created using Tensorflow to categorize the MNIST dataset

The MNIST dataset contains 16000 images of size 28X28. The images contain a set of hand drawn digits ranging from 0 to 9. This project utilizes Google's Tensorflow software library to create a two-layer convolutional neural network to classify images from the MNIST dataset. This script downloads the MNIST dataset, defines a Tensorflow graph and initializes a Tensorflow session. This script can further be used to optimize the neural network using the MNIST training data.
